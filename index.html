			Animal behaviour research is affected by researchers' assumptions and expectations, <br>
			impacting how the research is conducted, interpretation of behaviours, <br>
			research questions addressed, and taxonomic representation. <br>
			In addition, the STRANGE framework reveals biases in subject inclusion. <br>
		</p>
		<p>
			Animal behaviour, like other academic fields, is shaped by historical biases <br>
			influencing geographic coverage and whose research is recognised as influential. <br>
			Including diverse perspectives ensures new insights and robust science.			
		</p>
		<p>
			At the ASAB Winter Meeting 2024, we explore biases in animal behaviour research, and <br>
			discuss a comprehensive system change towards inclusivity and fairness. This involves <br>
			evaluating community needs and implementing explicit policies alongside implicit cultural changes.
		</p>
		<p>
			We aim to publish a special issue with conference proceedings.

			<!--
			The field of Animal Behaviour aims to understand the evolution of behaviour from ultimate and proximate levels and does this by applying observational and experimental methods in a wide range of species. 
			
			However, studying animal behaviour can be difficult and the aim to objectively quantify behaviour is often challenged by assumptions made by researchers. 
			
			As such, when conducting studies in the field of behaviour, a wide range of biases need to be considered, for example, observer biases or expectation bias. 
			
			A systematic review published in 2015 identified only 13.3% of studies in fields of ecology, evolution, and behavior applied a blind study design (Kardish et al., 2015). 
			
			Further, taxonomic biases strongly affect species studies, with endothermic vertebrates overrepresented in comparison to arthropods (Rosenthal et al., 2017). 
			
			Further, historic biases exist in the field, affecting the kind of research questions addressed, the geographical areas chosen, the lead researchers, and how research is conducted. 
			
			Similar to other academic fields, Animal Behaviour for a long time has been mostly shaped by dominant social groups (e.g., Western men), with others being historically excluded. 
			
			The academic system generally is regarded as a meritocracy, where individuals are rewarded based on their abilities and achievements.
			
			However, inequitable norms and policies lead to disparities in opportunities and recognition often resulting in lower productivity and job satisfaction of members from marginalized groups (Cech, 2022). 
			
			Factors like mentorship, institutional support, and access to resources can significantly impact an individual's success and achievements and access to support can be inequitable. 
			
			Losing people from historically marginalized groups from academia also means losing diverse perspectives from the academic system, resulting in reduced quality of scholarship and innovation (Gomez & Bernet, 2019).
			
			As a scientific society, ASAB has a responsibility to address these challenges, promote diversity and inclusion, and create a more equitable environment, which ultimately is essential to ensure best scientific advancement in the field of Animal Behaviour. 
			
			Identifying areas where replication and reanalysis would be most important would boost new scientific directions and the reliability of results in Animal Behaviour.
			
			Inclusion of individuals with diverse backgrounds and experiences in the research community brings a broader range of knowledge and perspectives to the field of Animal Behaviour. 
			
			Different cultural, societal, and personal experiences can shape the way individuals approach research. 
			
			This diversity of perspectives can lead to new insights, innovative research approaches, and a deeper understanding of the complexities of animal behavior. 
			
			Promoting a diverse and inclusive environment can help to identify and address biases and ensure that research and interpretations are based on robust science, rather than preconceived notions.  
		
			At the ASAB Winter Meeting 2024, we aim to bring together a diverse community of researchers for a critical examination of biases in the field. 
			We will foster discussions on adopting a system change approach to enhancing equity, and promoting diversity and inclusion in Animal Behaviour research.
			System change is based on an evaluation of the needs of a community, and addressing both explicit and implicit changes. 
			Explicit changes are implemented through policies, while implicit change involves addressing underlying biases or cultural factors influencing the system, 
			e.g., through awareness and sensitivity training, as well as equitable resource allocation.

			By employing a comprehensive system change strategy, we hope to contribute to a positive transformation within the field, towards promoting inclusivity and fairness.
